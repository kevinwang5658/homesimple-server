"40073682","It's early morning - you wake ready to step out into the cool morning air and step down into the beautiful serenity your mature neighbourhood offers. As you open the front door you take in that oh-so-familiar smell of the pines and begin your stroll down Moccasin Drive. The tranquility that surrounds you is one of the many reasons you purchased this home - this is the lifestyle you were searching for...and you found it here. Later, soaking in the early morning sun, you find your thoughts drift to the day you first purchased this beautiful home. It was the exact right fit for the family - space both upstairs and down to tailor to your sense of style, an HGTV adventure all your own. The way your eyes lit up, your heart skipped, the way you went through the house like a small child eager to see every room. You fell in love. You were home. Fast forward, mid-day you indulge in an early beverage while enjoying the sun on your rear deck. You've had a productive day in the home office and you're excited for what's to come. As the sun sets and dusk setttles in, like clockwork your guests arrive. Hours later you've laughed so much your cheeks hurt, you've toured people through your home so much you seem to know every inch better than before. People are smiling, laughing, feeling good and it's all because of you. The evening flourishes and everyone is having a blast. The children build snowmen and throw snowballs in the backyard while others enjoy music, laughter and conversation around the dining room table. Tonight will go down in the record books. Tonight is your night. Welcome home.
